.IP "--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN}"
Log level of dnsconfd, default INFO
.IP "--resolv-conf-path RESOLV_CONF_PATH"
Path to resolv.conf that the dnsconfd should manage, default /etc/resolv.conf
.IP "--prioritize-wire, --no-prioritize-wire"
If set to yes then wireless interfaces will have lower priority, default yes
.IP "--listen-address ADDRESS"
Address on which local resolver listens, default 127.0.0.1
.IP "--config-file PATH"
Path where config file is located, default /etc/dnsconfd.conf
.IP "--resolver-options options"
Options to be used in resolv.conf for alteration of resolver, default "edns0 trust-ad"
.IP "--dnssec-enabled, --no-dnssec-enabled"

.SH "EXIT STATUS"

.IP 0
Graceful stop.
.IP 8
DNS caching service failure. Service crashed for example.
.IP 9

.IP 10
Failed interaction with resolv.conf.
.IP 11
Failed to configure dns cache service.
.IP 12
Failed to set up necessary routes.
.IP 13
Bad arguments.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables have lower priority than command line options but higher
than configuration file. Boolean options recognize 'yes' or '1' as True, all
other values are considered as False.

.IP DBUS_NAME
DBUS name that dnsconfd should use, default org.freedesktop.resolve1
.IP LOG_LEVEL
Log level of dnsconfd, default INFO
.IP RESOLV_CONF_PATH
Path to resolv.conf that the dnsconfd should manage, default /etc/resolv.conf
.IP PRIORITIZE_WIRE
If set to yes then wireless interfaces will have lower priority, default yes
.IP LISTEN_ADDRESS
Address on which local resolver listens, default 127.0.0.1
.IP CONFIG_FILE
Path where config file is located, default /etc/dnsconfd.conf
.IP RESOLVER_OPTIONS
Options to be used in resolv.conf for alteration of resolver, default "edns0 trust-ad"
.IP DNSSEC_ENABLED
Enable dnssec record validation, default no
.IP HANDLE_ROUTING
Dnsconfd will submit necessary routes to routing manager, default yes
.IP API_CHOICE
Dnsconfd will switch between APIs. Allowed options are resolve1 and dnsconfd.
Default is resolve1

.SH FILES
Dnsconfd manages resolv.conf to route domain name resolution to local cache service.
Default location of the configuration file is /etc/dnsconfd.conf.

.SH ROUTING
Dnsconfd by default submits routes through NetworkManager, so system contacts
DNS servers through the right interfaces. This behaviour can be turned off
by setting handle_routing option to 'no'.

.SH NOTES
The only currently supported backend is Unbound.

.SH Installation

If you have systemd-resolved installed then you have to disable it first.

.IP "# systemctl disable --now systemd-resolved"

Stop systemd-resolved and disable its start on boot.

.IP "# systemctl mask systemd-resolved"

Mask the service so there are no conflicts.

.IP "# dnsconfd config install"

Modifies NetworkManager to explicitly use systemd-resolved dbus API, and
changes ownership of resolvconf so Dnsconfd does not need root privileges.

.IP "# systemctl enable --now dnsconfd"

Starts Dnsconfd and enables its startup on boot.
