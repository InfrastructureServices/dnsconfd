.SH NAME

Dnsconfd - local DNS cache configuration daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS

dnsconfd [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Dnsconfd is a local cache configuration daemon. It implements DBus interface of systemd-resolved
and translates its use to dns service's configuration.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-h, --help"
Show help message and exit
.IP "--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN}"
Log level of dnsconfd, default INFO
.IP "--resolv-conf-path RESOLV_CONF_PATH"
Path to resolv.conf that the dnsconfd should manage, default /etc/resolv.conf
.IP "--prioritize-wire, --no-prioritize-wire"
If set to yes then wireless interfaces will have lower priority, default yes
.IP "--listen-address ADDRESS"
Address on which local resolver listens, default 127.0.0.1
.IP "--config-file PATH"
Path where config file is located, default /etc/dnsconfd.conf
.IP "--resolver-options options"
Options to be used in resolv.conf for alteration of resolver, default "edns0 trust-ad"
.IP "--dnssec-enabled, --no-dnssec-enabled"
Enable dnssec record validation, default no
.IP "--stderr-log, --no-stderr-log"
Dnsconfd will write logs into stderr, default yes
.IP "--syslog-log, --no-syslog-log"
Dnsconfd will use syslog for logging, default no
.IP "--file-log"
Dnsconfd will write logs into specified file, not used by default
.IP "--certification-authority"
Space separated list of CA bundles used for encrypted protocols as default
when no custom CA was specified. The first one that can be accessed will be
used, default /etc/pki/dns/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem

.SH "EXIT STATUS"

.IP 0
Graceful stop.
.IP 8
DNS caching service failure. Service crashed for example.
.IP 9
Failed communication through DBUS.
.IP 10
Failed interaction with resolv.conf.
.IP 11
Failed to configure dns cache service.
.IP 13
Bad arguments.
.IP 14
Failed to initialize logs.
.IP 15
Failed to execute command.
.IP 16
Failed to update configuration.
.IP 17
Internal state machine failure.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables have lower priority than command line options but higher
than configuration file. Boolean options recognize 'yes' or '1' as True, all
other values are considered as False.

.IP LOG_LEVEL
Log level of dnsconfd, default INFO
.IP RESOLV_CONF_PATH
Path to resolv.conf that the dnsconfd should manage, default /etc/resolv.conf
.IP PRIORITIZE_WIRE
If set to yes then wireless interfaces will have lower priority, default yes
.IP LISTEN_ADDRESS
Address on which local resolver listens, default 127.0.0.1
.IP CONFIG_FILE
Path where config file is located, default /etc/dnsconfd.conf
.IP RESOLVER_OPTIONS
Options to be used in resolv.conf for alteration of resolver, default "edns0 trust-ad"
.IP DNSSEC_ENABLED
Enable dnssec record validation, default no
.IP STDERR_LOG
Dnsconfd will write logs into stderr, default yes
.IP SYSLOG_LOG
Dnsconfd will use syslog for logging, default no
.IP FILE_LOG
Dnsconfd will write logs into specified file, not used by default

.SH FILES
Dnsconfd manages resolv.conf to route domain name resolution to local cache service.
Default location of the configuration file is /etc/dnsconfd.conf.

.SH NOTES
The only currently supported backend is Unbound.

Although default is to use stderr for logs and not syslog, service is
distributed with sysconfig file that reverses this behaviour, so when
running Dnsconfd service you will have advantages of syslog logs.

.SH Installation

If you have systemd-resolved installed then you have to disable it first.

.IP "# systemctl disable --now systemd-resolved"

Stop systemd-resolved and disable its start on boot.

.IP "# systemctl mask systemd-resolved"

Mask the service so there are no conflicts.

.IP "# dnsconfd config install"

Modifies NetworkManager to explicitly use systemd-resolved dbus API, and
changes ownership of resolvconf so Dnsconfd does not need root privileges.

.IP "# systemctl enable --now dnsconfd"

Starts Dnsconfd and enables its startup on boot.
