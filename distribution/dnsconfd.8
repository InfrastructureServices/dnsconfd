.IP "# systemctl disable --now systemd-resolved"

Stop systemd-resolved and disable its start on boot.

.IP "# systemctl mask systemd-resolved"

Mask the service so there are no conflicts.

.IP "# dnsconfd config install"

Modifies NetworkManager to explicitly use systemd-resolved dbus API, and
changes ownership of resolvconf so Dnsconfd does not need root privileges.

.IP "# systemctl enable --now dnsconfd"

Starts Dnsconfd and enables its startup on boot.
