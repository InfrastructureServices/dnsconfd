.SH EXAMPLES
# dnsconfd update '[{"address":"192.168.6.3", "interface": 3}]'

# dnsconfd update '[{"address":"192.168.6.3", "protocol": "DoT", "sni": "named"}]'

Use only one server for all queries, enable dns over tls and verify that server
presents certificate containing hostname 'named'.

# dnsconfd update '[{"address":"192.168.6.3", "domains": [["first-domain.com", false]]}, {"address":"2001:db8::103"}]'

resolving plain hostnames and use 2001:db8::103 for resolving of any other name.
